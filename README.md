# Design Tools
A long time ago I designed a prototype in Photoshop, which was very helpful. I had problems when converting from PSD to App. It wasn't difficult but it took me a long time and I didn't know how to create animation in Photoshop.

I found the Sketch app 2 days ago and gave it a try. Amazing, no more Photoshop for me.ðŸ˜­

**Sketch**, my new friend in design tools. I had learned 2 days ago, it's amazing, easy learning, and you should learn it instead learn Photoshop
 
**Flinto** convert prototype in Sketch to animation preview. Before start code in react native, you need design a transition for `Scence`, you can caculator timing duration, position easy, and you should do it, your app will be wonderful animation.
 
**Zeplin** It help you convert from idea design to App. It's easy export image, get distance from other component, get CSS, and more, ...

You should learn it ðŸ˜˜
